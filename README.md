<!-- ### What I learned

For me, at the very early stages of a continuous learning process, it was definitely a good project to practice the fundamental features of React. I really enjoyed working on this, even tho it's a simple application. Could practice the basic hooks and had the chance to use a custom hook to store the actual ToDos on localstorage plus the chosen theme. -->
